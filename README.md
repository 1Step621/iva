# Iva

The video editor alternative to AviUtl.   
Work in progress...

```rs
"avi".chars().rev().collect::<String>()
```

## Known issues
Preview rendering is too laggy. This is due to Tauri's IPC overhead. I'm trying to solve this by rendering directly from the Tauri backend. https://zenn.dev/yadokani389/articles/rendering-with-rust-in-tauri-20250305
